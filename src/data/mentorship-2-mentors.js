        I love learning languages. What drew me to tech was the immense possibility of creating new things using language. At work, I make apps. I see my job as a way to enrich people's lives, enhance the way they work, and make it more meaningful. Outside work I enjoy martial arts, tasting whiskey with a dash of philosophizing, or test out my level of Chinese with kopi auntie.

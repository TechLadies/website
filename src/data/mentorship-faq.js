        The TechLadies Mentorship is designed to help women with existing domain
        knowledge in either Software Engineering, UI/UX Design, Data
        Science/Engineering/Analysis, or Product Management who are looking for
        guidance on how to get to the next level in their careers. This could be
        building influence, preparing for job interviews, or growing a network.

        you will be able to speak to every mentor present and provide us your

        The final project is something you decide on with your mentor at the
        start of the program, to create something which you can showcase,
        something concrete which you can take away from this 12-week mentorship
        program. For example, you can decide to work on a personal project and
        publish it on GitHub, taking part in a Kaggle competition, write a tech
        article etc.

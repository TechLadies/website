        Jeslyn is a business analyst at a cloud software startup. Before the
        startup life, she worked at an Entrepreneurship Education Centre
        surrounded by many purpose-driven startup founders. She was inspired by
        their stories and motivated to make an impact in the community. She has
        joined TechLadies to help more women to learn and grow as well as
        discovering their sparks. She believes life is a never ending learning
        process, now self-learning python coding and serious in finding the best
        hummus and natto in town.

        Most of the time, yes! We reserve seats for men at some of our in-person events and our online communities. However, TechLadies Mentorship and TechLadies Bootcamp are just for women and those who identify as one due to the resource limitation.

        We did not create TechLadies to make money, but we need money to keep TechLadies going. As such, we charge for some of our programs and events. We provide full scholarships for women with financial difficulties and cannot afford the fees.

        No, you don’t. As long as you can legally be in the country to take part in in-person events, you can join us! Do note that we cannot help with your visa applications.

        We did not create TechLadies to make money, but we need money to keep TechLadies going. As such, this program costs SGD550 to participate. Full scholarships are provided for women from low-income backgrounds and cannot afford the fees. You may request for a scholarship on the application form.

        Yes! We learned that it is important for TechLadies Bootcamp participants to have some sort of programming foundation in order to build the projects during the bootcamp. Hence, you will need to complete a technical task before applying to the TechLadies Bootcamp. Donâ€™t worry; we are here to help you acquire the skills you need to complete the task with a series of pre-bootcamp workshops!

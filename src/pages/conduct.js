          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            We (the TechLadies leadership team) put forth this code of conduct
            not because we expect inappropriate behavior, but because we believe
            in the already exceptional level of respect in the TechLadies
            community. We believe that articulating our values and
            accountabilities reinforce that respect and provide us with clear
            avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We commit to enforce and develop this code as our community grows. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This Code of Conduct applies to members of the TechLadies leadership
            team, community members, event attendees, volunteers, sponsors, and
            partners. It applies to interactions in various areas of our shared
            space, both online and offline, including all events and programs
            hosted by TechLadies and shared online spaces (Slack, email,
            Facebook, Twitter) 
          </p>
          <h2>
            TechLadies is not an <i>inclusive</i> community
          </h2>
          <p>
            Well, not in the way you are thinking. We are dedicated to providing
            a safe and comfortable environment for women, non-binary people, and
            male allies. We are for-women, but we are not anti-men. We celebrate
            our unique differences and are united by TechLadies’ vision of
            seeing more women take part in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this well, there are certain people that we do not accept. We
            do not welcome behaviors that exclude, discriminate, or harass
            others based on their: gender, gender identity and expression, age,
            sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
            race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political views, marital
            status, parental status, socioeconomic status, previous TechLadies’
            events/programs attendance or lack of, computing experience or lack
            of, chosen programming language or tech stack.
          </p>

          <p>
            As TechLadies is volunteer-led and has limited resources, we would
            prefer that people do not abuse the resources provided by TechLadies
            and/or our sponsors. Such abuse could be in the form of, including
            but not limited to, theft, hogging resources (such as tickets or
            refreshments), and falsifying information for personal gains. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically... we don’t welcome people with inappropriate behaviors. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To elaborate on what “excludes, discriminates, or harasses” means,
            it includes but is not limited to: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>violent threats or language directed against another person</li>
            <li>discriminatory jokes and language</li>
            <li>sexually explicit or violent material</li>
            <li>
              posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personal
              identifying information (“doxing”)
            </li>
            <li>
              personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
            </li>
            <li>unwelcomed sexual attention</li>
            <li>stalking</li>
            <li>
              photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent
            </li>
            <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
            <li>inappropriate physical contact</li>
            <li>advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In general, be kind to others. And if someone is asked to stop any
            harassing behavior, please comply immediately.
          </p>
          <h2>Notice it, report it </h2>
          <p>
            When something goes wrong—whether it’s a microaggression or an
            instance of harassment—there are some things you can do to make sure
            the situation is addressed.

              <b>In urgent cases:</b> If you believe anyone or yourself is in
              physical danger, please notify law enforcement first and remove
              yourself or the victim from the location. If you require immediate
              support, please reach out to any TechLadies leadership team.

              You can make a report either personally or anonymously, and all
              reports are confidential. Where we determine that a public
              statement will need to be made, the identities of all victims and
              reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals
              instruct us otherwise. If you are unsure whether the incident is a
              violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by
              this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We
              would much rather have a few extra reports where we take no
              action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do
              not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a
              violation.

              approach only if you feel comfortable and confident in holding

            This includes education on why a behavior violated the Code of

            offender issue an apology (publicly or privately), expulsion from
            events and programs with no refunds (if applicable), expulsion from
            shared online spaces, expulsion from volunteering with TechLadies in
            any capacity or reporting their behavior to local law enforcement.

          <h2>What happens after you file a report?</h2>
          <p>
            If you’ve made an anonymous report, you will not receive any updates
            or resolution regarding the violation as we cannot reach out to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you make a report personally (with your contact details), you
            will receive an automated email showing that we’ve received your
            report. Thereafter, an assigned member of the TechLadies leadership
            team will reach out to you within 24 hours to acknowledge that we
            have seen your report.

              What happened; If this behavior violated our CoC; Who the bad
              actor was; Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a
              threat to anyone’s physical safety
            </li>
            <li>
              Decide on a resolution. Factors affecting our decision includes
              but is not limited to:
              <ul>
                <li>Could this behavior be avoided? </li>
                <li>Is this a repeat offender?</li>
                <li>What is this behavior’s impact on the victim? </li>
                <li>
                  What is this behavior’s impact on the broader TechLadies
                  community?
                </li>
              </ul>

            <li>
              reply to you with either a resolution or an explanation of why the
              incident is not yet resolved
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Where we determine that a public statement will need to be made, the
            identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential
            unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any of the parties directly involved can request a reconsideration
            of the TechLadies Leadership team’s decision. To make such a
            request, contact anyone listed on the About page or email Elisha
            directly at elisha@techladies.co with your request and motivation
            and we will review the case.

          <h2>Take care of each other</h2>
          <p>
            If you ever witness something that seems misaligned with our values,
            err on the side of caring for fellow community members. Even if an
            incident seems minor, reach out to the person affected by it to
            check-in. We’d also appreciate it if you would speak to a member of
            the TechLadies leadership team directly to voice your concerns.
